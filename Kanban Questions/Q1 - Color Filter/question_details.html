<!-- Problem Description :
Write a JavaScript program to:

Implement the filter feature for the tickets based on the priority colors. (lightpink, lightgreen, lightblue, black)

Task 1:
Whenever a particular color is clicked from the toolbox => 
    1.1 Remove all the existing tickets from Document.
    1.2 Only the tickets with the assigned priority colors should be added to the Document.

Task 2: 
Whenever any of the color is double clicked => 
    1.1 Remove all the existing tickets from Document.
    1.2 All the tickets (regardless of color) should be added to the Document.

Important information and algorithms:

1. How to add a ticket to the document?
createTicket(ticket-task, ticket-color, ticket-id) function has been provided in the script.js, 
this function creates and adds a ticket to the Document with below structure. 

Ticket structure : <div class="ticket-cont">
                        <div class="ticket-color"></div>
                        <div class="ticket-id">id 1</div>
                        <div class="task-area"> this  is task 1</div>
                        <div class="ticket-lock">
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-lock"></i>
                    </div> 

2. How to access the ticket information (ticket-task, ticket-color, ticket-id)?
To create the tickets, you would utilise createTicket(ticket-task, ticket-color, ticket-id) function,
this function requires several parameters as input.
To access these ticket values, you are provided a global variable ticketsArr 
which is an Array of Objects holding objects containing individual values (ticketTask, ticketColor, ticketID) of 4 tickets.  

3. How to remove all the tickets from the document?
To remove unwanted tickets from the Document, utilise DOM function Element.remove()
To select a ticket element to, use class 'ticket-cont', as descibed on the ticket structure above.  

Below are the algorithms that need to be followed for both the tasks,

Algorithm for Task 1:
Step 1. After removing every ticket from the Document.
Step 2. You can access 'ticketsArr' array, 
Step 3. filter it on the basis of the selected color from the toolBox (don't overwrite global array 'ticketsArr')
Step 4. and create individual tickets for the filtered ticket objects.

Algorithm for Task 2:
Step 1. After removing every ticket from the Document.
Step 2. You can access 'ticketsArr' array, 
Step 3. and create individual tickets for all the ticket objects.

Further, please focus on passing testcases to submit the problem successfully.

<!-- Hints:
1. Access the toolBox color boxes array using querySelectorAll with '.color' selector.
2. Traverse on this array and add an Element.addEventListener('click') on each of the box.
3. In the callback function for this eventListener of 'click', code the algorithm for Task 1 mentioned in the problem description.
4. Again, while traversing the array, add an Element.addEventListener('dblclick') on each of the box.
5. In the callback function for this eventListener of 'dblclick', code the algorithm for Task 2 mentioned in the problem description.
6. Don't overwrite the global array ticketsArr.
-->

<!-- Test cases:
1. Verify that clicking on lightpink color box is working.
2. Verify that clicking on lightgreen color box is working.
3. Verify that clicking on lightblue color box is working.
4. Verify that clicking on black color box is working.
5. Verify that double clicking on any of the color box is working. -->
