<!-- Problem Description:
Write a JavaScript program in the <script> tag to:

Implement the locking mehcanism feature for all the tickets present. 

The feature works under two different states of locked and unlocked.

State 1. When the ticket is locked and clicked:

1. locked icon changes to unlocked icon.
2. task-area is set to editable.

State 2. When the ticket is unlocked and clicked:

1. unlocked icon changes to locked icon.
2. task-area is set to uneditable.

Important information and algorithms:

1. How to change the icons, editability of task and keep an account of state?
You are provided with two image icons: lock-icon.png and unlock-icon.png
and the structure of the ticket is as follows:

<div class="ticket-color ${ticketColor}"></div>
<div class="ticket-id">${id}</div>
<div class="task-area">${ticketTask}</div>
<div class="ticket-lock">
    <img src="lock-icon.png" alt="Lock Icon" height="20px" width="20px">
</div>

Based on these, below is the algorithm to be followed.

Algorithm:
You can to utilise the class of the parent div of img(icon) to find the current state, if its state 1 (locked) or state 2 (unlocked).
Then whenever the icon is clicked:
In state 1, you need to:
1. change the class of 'ticket-lock' to 'ticket-unlock'
2. change the src of img from 'lock-icon.png' to 'unlock-icon.png'
3. set the contenteditable attribute of task-area to true

In state 2, you need to:
1. change the class of 'ticket-unlock' to 'ticket-lock'
2. change the src of img from 'unlock-icon.png' to 'lock-icon.png'
3. set the contenteditable attribute of task-area to false

After performing the above steps, its also important to update the global ticketArr array with the new ticketTask. 

Further, please focus on passing testcases to submit the problem successfully.

<!-- Hints:
1. Use document.querySelectorAll('.ticket-cont') to get access to all the tickets in the document and store them in an array.
2. Traverse this array and add a 'click' eventListener to the icon of each of the ticket container element in the array.
3. Get access to the: icon's parent div, icon's image and ticket's task-are using relevant selectors
4. Utilise the class of the parent div of img(icon) to find the current state
5. Use conditional statements (if-else) to write the algorithm based on states, which is mentioned in the description.
-->

<!-- Test cases:
1. Verify that clicking on lock icon changes it to unlock icon.
2. Verify that clicking on unlock icon changes it to lock icon.
3. Verify that when the state is locked, the task is uneditable.
4. Verify that when the state is unlocked, the task is editable.  -->
