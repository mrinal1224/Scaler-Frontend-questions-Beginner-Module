<!-- Problem Description:
Write a JavaScript program in the <script> tag to:

Implement the locking mehcanism feature for all the tickets present. 

The feature works under two different states of locked and unlocked.

State 1. When the ticket is locked and clicked:

1. locked button changes to unlocked button.
2. task-area is set to editable.

State 2. When the ticket is unlocked and clicked:

1. unlocked button changes to locked button.
2. task-area is set to uneditable.

Important information and algorithms:

1. How to change the buttons, editability of task and keep an account of state?
You are provided a single button inside the div.ticket-lock, 
and the structure of the ticket is as follows:

<div class="ticket-color ${ticketColor}"></div>
<div class="ticket-id">${id}</div>
<div class="task-area">${ticketTask}</div>
<div class="ticket-lock">
    <button>Locked</button>
</div>

Based on these, below is the algorithm to be followed.

Algorithm:
You can to utilise the class (will be ticket-lock or ticket-unlock) of the parent div of button to find the current state, if its state 1 (locked) or state 2 (unlocked).
Then whenever the button is clicked:
In state 1, you need to:
1. change the class of 'ticket-lock' to 'ticket-unlock'
2. change the innerText of button from 'Locked' to 'Unlocked'
3. set the contenteditable attribute of task-area to true

In state 2, you need to:
1. change the class of 'ticket-unlock' to 'ticket-lock'
2. change the innerText of button from 'Unlocked' to 'Locked'
3. set the contenteditable attribute of task-area to false

After performing the above steps, its also important to update the global ticketArr array with the new ticketTask. 

Further, please focus on passing testcases to submit the problem successfully.

<!-- Hints:
1. Use document.querySelectorAll('.ticket-cont') to get access to all the tickets in the document and store them in an array.
2. Traverse this array and add a 'click' eventListener to the button of each of the ticket container element in the array.
3. Get access to the: button's parent div, button and ticket's task-are using relevant selectors
4. Utilise the class of the parent div of button to find the current state
5. Use conditional statements (if-else) to write the algorithm based on states, which is mentioned in the description.
-->

<!-- Test cases:
1. Verify that clicking on lock button changes it to unlock button.
2. Verify that clicking on unlock button changes it to lock button.
3. Verify that when the state is locked, the task is uneditable.
4. Verify that when the state is unlocked, the task is editable.  -->
