<!-- Problem Description:
Write a JavaScript program in the <script> tag to:

Implement the delete feature for all the tickets present. 
The feature should work as follows:
1. When the Delete Button (div.remove-btn), which is a cross button in the tool bar, is clicked:
    1.1. It gives an alert that the 'delete button has been activated' 
    1.2. This means that now if any ticket is clicked, it gets removed from the UI (User Interface)
    1.3. The background color of the div with class 'remove-btn' turns 'red' when the delete button is activated.
2. When the Delete Button is clicked again:
    2.1. It deactivates the delete button
    2.2. This means now clicking on a ticket would no longer remove it from the UI.
    2.3. The background color of the div with class 'remove-btn' turns back to inherited bgcolor from parent.

Important information and algorithms:

1. How to keep an account of states associated with delete button?

The delete button is in the following structure:
<div class="action-btn-cont">
    <div class="remove-btn">
        <img src="cross-logo.png" alt="cross-logo" height="50%">
    </div>
</div>

Here, div.action-btn-cont is the toolbox containing div.remove-btn with an image of cross inscribed in it.
So when the the div.remove-btn is clicked, it should make the delete feature work. 

To know whether the delete button is activated or not, you can utlise a global boolean variable working as a Flag.

Algorithm to set states:
Whenever delete button is clicked:
If the Flag says the delete button was inactive:
1. negate the Flag value.
2. create an Alert that says 'delete button has been activated'
3. set the background color of div.remove-btn to 'red'

If the Flag says the delete button was active:
1. negate the Flag value.
2. set the background color of div.remove-btn to 'inherit'

2. How to remove a ticket from the UI?

Algorithm to remove a ticket:
For each of the ticket, add an eventListener of 'click' such that whenever a ticket is clicked,
it checks the Flag value determing the activation state of the delete button.
If the Flag says the delete button is inactive:
1. Don't do anything and return back.

If the Flag says the delete button is active:
1. Use the Element.remove() function to remove the ticket from the UI.

As a bonus:
After performing the above steps, you can try to update the global ticketArr array by removing the ticket data from it as well.

Further, please focus on passing testcases to submit the problem successfully.

<!-- Hints:
1. Both the Algorithms, 1 and 2 from the problem description need to be implemented seperately.
2. Algorithm 1 should be followed in the callback function for the 'click' eventListener on the div.remove-btn (delete button).
3. Use document.querySelectorAll('.ticket-cont') to get access to all the tickets in the document and store them in an array.
4. Traverse this array and add a 'click' eventListener to the ticket that handles Algorithm 2 from the description.
-->

<!-- Test cases:
1. Verify that clicking on inactive delete button gives out an alert saying 'delete button has been activated'
2. Verify that clicking on inactive delete button turns the background color of the div.remove-btn to 'red'.
3. Verify that clicking on inactive delete button turns the background color of the div.remove-btn to 'inherit'.
4. Verify that when the delete button is active, clicking on a ticket removes it from UI.
5. Verify that when the delete button is inactive, clicking on a ticket does nothing.  -->
