<!-- Problem Description:

Write a JS program to make the given OTP input work properly.

In the Document, you have div#inputs that contains 4 input fields with 'input' class.
Here is how these inputs should work:
1. Each of the field only takes a single digit number as input.
2. When a number is entered, the focus moves to the next input field.
3. Pressing Backspace or Delete key removes the input of current field, and focus moves to the previous field.

You can utilise methods like isNan(value), Element.focus(), Element.nextElementSibling and Element.previousElementSibling to make the above mentioned features work.

Use the above information to write the entire JS program in the script.js file or script tag.
Refer to the test cases to further understand the criterias to submit the problem successfully.

NOTE:
HTML and CSS are handled for you, please don't change the structure of the document.

<!-- Hints:
1. Add eventListener of 'input' on div#inputs to track the inputs being made to children feilds.
2. In the call back of the above eventListener, utilise the event object to get the target Element.
3. Make use of the methods like isNan(value), Element.focus(), Element.nextElementSibling and Element.previousElementSibling on the target Element.
4. Add eventListener of 'keyup' to keep track of Backspace or Delete key being pressed.
5. Use isNan(value) to check if the input being made is a valid number or not.   -->


<!-- Test cases:
1. Verify that the input fields only take a number as valid input.
2. Verify that the focus movies to the next input field whenever a single digit is entered.
3. Verify that when Backspace or Delete key is pressed, it removes the input from current field.
4. Verify that when Backspace or Delete key is pressed, the focus gets back to previous field.   -->
