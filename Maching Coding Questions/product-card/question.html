<!-- Problem Description:
Write a JS program to display information of various products from a list. 
Read the entire problem description carefully to understand the necessary details.

You are provided with: (Don't make any changes to below mentioned files)
1. index.html => containing basic document structure
2. styles.css => contains styling
3. and data.js => has a data variable that contains an Array of Objects with details of several products.

As you can access the data array, your task is to
write a program to make a product card for each of the product's object inside this array.

Algorithm:
1. Traverse through the data Array. 
2. Individually accessing each product's Object.
3. Inject relevant details like title, category, rating-count in the below mentioned HTML template to make a div.card.
4. To make the rating stars:
    4.1. Round off the rating.rate value of an object to nearest Integer
    4.2. Use this value to determine the number of empty and filled stars out of 5. (Ex: For a rating of 3/5 => 3 filled stars and 2 empty stars)
    4.3. Utilise these values in a loop to make filled and empty stars
    4.4. To make filled star symbol use '&#9733;' and for empty star use '&#9734;' 
    4.5. Wrap these stars inside a div as shown below.
5. Finally, after the div.card is ready with all the details injected, add it to div#container 

The HTML structure of a card is as follow:

<div class="card">
        <div class="details">
            <span class="product__name">${product.title}</span>
            <br>
            <span class="product__category">${product.category}</span>
            <div class="all__star">
                    <span class="star__filled">&#9733;</span>
                    <span class="star__filled">&#9733;</span>
                    <span class="star__filled">&#9733;</span>
                    <span class="star__filled">&#9733;</span>
                    <span class="star__notfilled">&#9734;</span>
            </div>
            <div class="rating__count">Rating Count : <span>${product.rating.count}</span></div>
        </div>
        <div class="btn">
            <button class="btn__buy">Buy Now</button>
        </div>
</div>

and object inside the data array has the following structure:
{
    id: 1,
    title: "Sample Product 1",
    price: 109.95,
    description:
      "Your perfect pack for everyday use and walks in the forest. Stash your laptop (up to 15 inches) in the padded sleeve, your everyday",
    category: "men's clothing",
    image: "https://fakestoreapi.com/img/81fPKd-2AYL._AC_SL1500_.jpg",
    rating: {
      rate: 3.9,
      count: 120,
    },
}

Use the above information to write the entire JS program in the script.js file or script tag. (below the script tag loading data.js file)
Refer to the test cases to further understand the criterias to submit the problem successfully.

<!--  Hints:
1. Traverse on the data array to access individual object.
2. Use document.createElement('div') to create a div that will hold all the spans containing individual stars.
3. Follow the step 4 of algorithm and utilise 2 loops to add spans containing filled and empty stars to the above div.
4. `<div class="card">
        <div class="details">
            <span class="product__name">${product.title}</span>
            <br>
            <span class="product__category">${product.category}</span>
            <div class="all__star">
              ${allStarDiv.innerHTML}
            </div>
            <div class="rating__count">Rating Count : <span>${product.rating.count}</span></div>
        </div>
        <div class="btn">
            <button class="btn__buy">Buy Now</button>
        </div>
    </div>`

    Use this as the template and add the innerHTML of your stars div to the div.all__star as mentioned above.
5. Utilise template literal as mentioned above to inject the values inside the HTML template.
6. Finally, when done use document.getElementById('container').innerHTML += `THE ABOVE TEMPLATE` to add the card to the document inside div#container.

<!-- Test cases:
1. Verify that a total of 20 product cards (div.card) are present in the Document.
2. Verify that a card holds a valid title.
3. Verify that a card holds a valid category.
4. Verify that a card holds a valid rating count.
5. Verify that a card contains correct star rating. (number of empty and filled stars) -->
