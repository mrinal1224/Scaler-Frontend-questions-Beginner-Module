// Question 1:
// What is the command to create a new React application using Create React App?
// a) react-app new my-app
// b) create-react-app my-app
// c) npm create-react-app my-app
// d) new-react-app my-app
// [ANS] b) create-react-app my-app

// Explanation: The correct command to create a new React application using Create React App is "create-react-app my-app". Option b is the correct answer.

// Question 2:
// Which of the following is a functional component in React?
// a) class MyComponent extends React.Component
// b) const MyComponent = () => {...}
// c) function MyComponent = () => {...}
// d) render() {...}
// [ANS] b) const MyComponent = () => {...}

// Explanation: Option b represents a functional component in React, as it uses arrow function syntax to define the component. Functional components are JavaScript functions that return JSX elements.

// Question 3:
// What is the purpose of the "render" method in a React component?
// a) To define the component's initial state
// b) To handle user input and trigger events
// c) To define the component's layout and structure
// d) To render the component's JSX markup
// [ANS] d) To render the component's JSX markup

// Explanation: The "render" method in a React component is responsible for rendering the JSX markup of the component. It determines what gets displayed on the screen when the component is rendered.

// Question 4:
// Which lifecycle method is called immediately after a component is added to the DOM?
// a) componentDidMount
// b) componentDidUpdate
// c) componentWillUnmount
// d) componentWillMount
// [ANS] a) componentDidMount

// Explanation: The "componentDidMount" lifecycle method is invoked immediately after a component is added to the DOM. It is commonly used to perform side effects, such as fetching data from an API or subscribing to events.

// Question 5:
// What is the purpose of the "useState" hook in React?
// a) To handle component lifecycle events
// b) To manage and update the component's state
// c) To create reusable custom hooks
// d) To define the component's props
// [ANS] b) To manage and update the component's state

// Explanation: The "useState" hook is used in functional components to add state management capabilities. It allows components to store and update their own state without needing a class-based component.

// Question 6:
// Which of the following is the correct way to pass props to a component in React?
// a) <MyComponent>{props}</MyComponent>
// b) <MyComponent props={...} />
// c) <MyComponent {...props} />
// d) <MyComponent>[props]</MyComponent>
// [ANS] c) <MyComponent {...props} />

// Explanation: Option c represents the correct way to pass props to a component in React. The spread operator ({...props}) is used to pass all the properties of the "props" object as individual props to the component.

// Question 7:
// Which file contains the main entry point of a React application?
// a) index.html
// b) index.js
// c) main.js
// d) app.js
// [ANS] b) index.js

// Explanation: The main entry point of a React application is typically the "index.js" file. It is the file where the React DOM is rendered into the HTML document.

// Question 8:
// What is the purpose of the "key" prop in React when rendering lists?
// a) It assigns a unique identifier to each item in the list
// b) It defines the styling for each item in the list
// c) It specifies the number of items to be rendered in the list
// d) It determines the order of items in the list
// [ANS] a) It assigns a unique identifier to each item in the list

// Explanation: The "key" prop is used when rendering lists in React to assign a unique identifier to each item. It helps React efficiently update and re-render the list when its items change.

// Question 9:
// Which of the following is true about React components?
// a) Components can only be defined as classes
// b) Components can be either class-based or functional
// c) Components can only be defined as functions
// d) Components can only be used within other components
// [ANS] b) Components can be either class-based or functional

// Explanation: React components can be defined either as classes (class-based components) or as functions (functional components). Both types of components have their uses and can be used interchangeably.

// Question 10:
// What is the purpose of the "ReactDOM.render" method in React?
// a) To update the state of a component
// b) To render a React component into the DOM
// c) To define the routing logic for a React application
// d) To handle user interactions and events
// [ANS] b) To render a React component into the DOM

// Explanation: The "ReactDOM.render" method is used to render a React component into the DOM. It takes the component and the target DOM element as arguments and renders the component's JSX markup onto the specified DOM element.
