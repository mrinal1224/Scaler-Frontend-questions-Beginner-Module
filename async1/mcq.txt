Which keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function in JavaScript?
a) sync
b) async
c) await
d) promise
Correct Answer: b) async
Explanation: The keyword "async" is used to declare an asynchronous function in JavaScript. It allows the function to use the "await" keyword to pause execution and wait for a promise to resolve or reject.

Which method is used to explicitly create a resolved promise in JavaScript?
a) Promise.reject()
b) Promise.resolve()
c) Promise.all()
d) Promise.race()
Correct Answer: b) Promise.resolve()
Explanation: The "Promise.resolve()" method is used to explicitly create a resolved promise in JavaScript. It returns a new promise that is resolved with the provided value.

Which method is used to catch errors in an asynchronous function?
a) try-catch statement
b) catch() method
c) then() method
d) finally() method
Correct Answer: b) catch() method
Explanation: The "catch()" method is used to catch errors in an asynchronous function. It is chained to a promise and called when the promise is rejected.

Which operator is used to await a promise inside an async function?
a) && operator
b) || operator
c) + operator
d) await operator
Correct Answer: d) await operator
Explanation: The "await" operator is used to pause the execution of an async function until a promise is resolved or rejected. It can only be used inside an async function.

Which method is used to delay the execution of code in JavaScript?
a) setTimeout()
b) setInterval()
c) setImmediate()
d) clearTimeout()
Correct Answer: a) setTimeout()
Explanation: The "setTimeout()" method is used to delay the execution of code in JavaScript. It takes a function as an argument and a specified delay in milliseconds.

What does the "Promise.all()" method do?
a) Executes multiple promises in parallel and returns a new promise that resolves when all promises are resolved.
b) Executes multiple promises in parallel and returns a new promise that resolves when any promise is resolved.
c) Executes multiple promises in sequence and returns a new promise that resolves when all promises are resolved.
d) Executes multiple promises in sequence and returns a new promise that resolves when any promise is resolved.
Correct Answer: a) Executes multiple promises in parallel and returns a new promise that resolves when all promises are resolved.
Explanation: The "Promise.all()" method is used to execute multiple promises in parallel. It takes an array of promises as an argument and returns a new promise that resolves when all the promises in the array are resolved.

Which method is used to chain multiple asynchronous operations together in JavaScript?
a) then()
b) catch()
c) finally()
d) all()
Correct Answer: a) then()
Explanation: The "then()" method is used to chain multiple asynchronous operations together in JavaScript. It is called on a promise and takes a callback function as an argument.

Which method is used to handle cleanup operations after a promise settles?
a) then()
b) catch()
c) finally()
d) all()
Correct Answer: c) finally()
Explanation: The "finally()" method is used to handle cleanup operations after a promise settles, whether it is resolved or rejected. It is called on a promise and takes a callback function as an argument.

What is the purpose of the "async/await" syntax in JavaScript?
a) To make asynchronous code synchronous.
b) To make synchronous code asynchronous.
c) To handle errors in asynchronous code.
d) To handle errors in synchronous code.
Correct Answer: a) To make asynchronous code synchronous.
Explanation: The "async/await" syntax in JavaScript is used to make asynchronous code appear and behave more like synchronous code. It allows developers to write asynchronous code in a more sequential and readable manner.

What is the advantage of using promises in asynchronous JavaScript code?
a) Promises simplify error handling in asynchronous code.
b) Promises automatically handle memory management in asynchronous code.
c) Promises improve performance in asynchronous code.
d) Promises eliminate the need for callbacks in asynchronous code.
Correct Answer: a) Promises simplify error handling in asynchronous code.
Explanation: Promises simplify error handling in asynchronous code by allowing developers to chain "catch()" methods and handle errors in a more structured manner.

Which method is used to reject a promise with a reason?
a) Promise.resolve()
b) Promise.reject()
c) Promise.catch()
d) Promise.finally()
Correct Answer: b) Promise.reject()
Explanation: The "Promise.reject()" method is used to explicitly reject a promise with a reason. It returns a new promise that is rejected with the provided reason.

What does the "async" keyword do when used before a function definition?
a) It makes the function run asynchronously.
b) It automatically converts the function into a promise.
c) It ensures the function is executed before other asynchronous code.
d) It enables the use of the "await" keyword inside the function.
Correct Answer: d) It enables the use of the "await" keyword inside the function.
Explanation: The "async" keyword, when used before a function definition, enables the use of the "await" keyword inside the function. It allows the function to pause execution and wait for promises to resolve or reject.

Which method is used to combine the results of multiple promises into a single promise?
a) Promise.combine()
b) Promise.merge()
c) Promise.all()
d) Promise.race()
Correct Answer: c) Promise.all()
Explanation: The "Promise.all()" method is used to combine the results of multiple promises into a single promise. It takes an array of promises as an argument and returns a new promise that resolves when all the promises in the array are resolved.

What happens if a promise is rejected and no "catch()" method is called on it?
a) The program crashes.
b) The promise remains in a pending state.
c) The error is silently ignored.
d) An unhandled promise rejection error is thrown.
Correct Answer: d) An unhandled promise rejection error is thrown.
Explanation: If a promise is rejected and no "catch()" method is called on it, an unhandled promise rejection error is thrown. It is important to handle promise rejections to avoid such errors.

Which method is used to create a new promise in JavaScript?
a) Promise.new()
b) new Promise()
c) Promise.create()
d) createPromise()
Correct Answer: b) new Promise()
Explanation: The "new Promise()" syntax is used to create a new promise in JavaScript. It takes a callback function as an argument, which provides the "resolve" and "reject" functions.
