<!-- Problem Description:
Create a Projects section where projects will be showcased with necessary headings, divs and Images with project logos and project description.
 -->


<!-- Hints:
Use the <section> tag that contains all the projects' components.
Use the <h1> tag for section heading 'My Projects'.
Group all the components for each project in seperate <div> tags.
Use the <img> tag to add a logo for the project.
Use the 'src' and 'alt' attributes of the <img> tag to specify the source and alternate text of the image respectively.
Use the <h2> tag for project heading.
Use the <p> tag for project description. -->

<!-- Solution Approach:
Start by creating the basic structure of the HTML document using the <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.
Add a <section> that will contain all the projects' components.
Use <h1> tag to specify the heading for the section as 'My Projects'.
Add a <div> tag, this will contain all the required project components for a single project.
Inside the <div> tag, add <img>, <h2> and <p> tags to specify project's logo, heading and description respectively.
Repeat the last two steps to add details for multiple projects.
You can further divide and group different components under <div> tags as a good coding practice. -->


<!-- Test Cases:
Verify that the webpage has a proper structure using the <html>, <head>, and <body> tags. 
Verify that the webpage has a <section> tag.
Verify that the webpage has a <h1> tag that contains the heading 'My Projects'.
Verify that the webpage has <div> tag that groups project's components like <img>, <h2> and <p>.
Verify that the webpage has an image using the <img> tag with 'src' and 'alt' attributes.
Verify that the webpage has a heading and description using the <h2> and <p> tags respectively.-->
