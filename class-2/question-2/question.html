<!-- Problem Description:
Create an HTML form for a survey to collect information about the favorite food of people. The survey should include the following fields:
Name (text input)
Age (number input)
Gender (radio buttons with Male and Female options)
Favorite Food (drop-down list with options like Pizza, Chinese food, Indian food, etc.)
Do you like to cook? (checkbox with Yes/No options)
Additional comments (textarea input)
Submit button
-->

<!-- Hints -
Use the appropriate input type for each field.
Use labels to associate each field with its respective input element.
The form should have an action attribute that specifies where the form data should be sent when submitted.
The form should have a method attribute that specifies how the form data should be submitted.
 -->

<!-- Solution Approach-> -->

<!-- Start by creating the basic structure of the form using the <form> element.
Add a text input for the name field and associate it with a label.
Add a number input for the age field and associate it with a label.
Add radio buttons for the gender field and associate them with a label.
Add a drop-down list for the favorite food field and associate it with a label.
Add a checkbox for the "Do you like to cook?" field and associate it with a label.
Add a textarea for the additional comments field and associate it with a label.
Add a submit button to submit the form data.
Add the action and method attributes to the form. -->


<!-- Test cases ->
Verify if the form has input fields of following ids: name, age, male, female, cook. Along with select tag with id as 'food', textarea and submit button at last.

Test the form elements have the correct values: Verify if the form elements have the correct default values or options (e.g. gender radio buttons, favorite food drop-down menu, etc.). -->
