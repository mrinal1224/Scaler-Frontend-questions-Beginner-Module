4. Add a solid gray border of 10 pixels to input of having type of 'text'.

Hints:
Use type selectors to select HTML elements by their element type.
Use class selectors to select elements by their class attribute.
Use ID selectors to select elements by their id attribute.
Use attribute selectors to select elements based on the values of their attributes.
Use pseudo-class selectors to select elements based on their state or position. -->

<!--
Solution Approach:
Identify the elements that need to be styled.
Determine the appropriate selector for each element.
Write the CSS code to style the elements using the selected selectors. -->
