<!-- Problem Description:
Create an HTML page that demonstrates the use of position property.

Inside the container <div>:
1. The page should display 4 boxes (divs with 'box' as class). 
2. Each with unique class 'absolute', 'relative', 'fixed', and 'static'.
3. Use CSS to set the associated position attribute respectively. 
4. Give all boxes unique top, right, left, bottom values as well.

Ex: 
<div class="box absolute"></div> 
should have position set to 'absolute'.

-->
<!-- 
Hints:
Use the position property to set the position of the boxes.
Use top, left, bottom, and right properties to adjust the position of the boxes relative to their parent container. -->

<!-- Test Cases:
Verify that the first box is positioned absolute.
Verify that the second box is positioned relative.
Verify that the third box is positioned fixed.
Verify that the fourth box is positioned static. -->

<!-- Solution Approach:
Create an HTML page with 4 div containers representing each box.
Apply different position values to each box using the position property.
Use top, left, bottom, and right properties to adjust the position of each box relative to their parent container.
Add styling to the boxes to give them a visual appearance. -->
